continuous

1D --> Histogram
2D---> Density plot
3D --> bubble chart
density numerical --> scatter 3D

Catogorical:
2D ---> Bar, Pie--> for <= 5 categories
 2D -- repeted values in multi category in same dimention ---> stacked bar
Ex: Gender for each points
3D ---> pair wise scatter plot
3D --> kernal density plot
multi dimentional ---> FacetGrid

Correlation of columns --> Heatmap



Identifing the values where actually spread more from total
Ex: 1-3 is less 3-6 is more 6-8 medium and 8-10 less (density spread)
---> scatter, violin
density numerical --> scatter 3D



to check Quality points (outliers)
1D ----> box plot

Location ---> Map
